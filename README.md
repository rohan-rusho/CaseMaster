# CaseMaster Android App

CaseMaster is an Android application designed to help users easily convert text between different letter casings, such as uppercase, lowercase, and title case. The app features a simple and intuitive interface with bottom navigation for quick access to its conversion tools.

## Features

*   **Text Case Conversion:** Easily convert input text to:
    *   UPPERCASE
    *   lowercase
    *   Title Case
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and straightforward design for ease of use.
*   **Bottom Navigation:** Simple navigation to switch between different conversion functionalities (if more are added in the future) or aspects of the app.
*   **Modern UI:** Utilizes Material Components for a contemporary look and feel.

## Structure

The application's main screen is defined in `activity_main.xml`. It consists of:

*   A `FrameLayout` (`@id/fragment_container`): This container is likely used to host different fragments, potentially for different types of text operations or settings.
*   A `TextView` (`@id/bottomInstruction`): Displays an instructional message "Convert text â†” Upper / Lowwer / Title!" above the bottom navigation.
*   A `com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationView` (`@id/bottomNavigation`): Provides the main navigation mechanism for the app. The menu items are defined in `res/menu/bottom_nav_menu.xml`.

## Key Components Used

*   **AndroidX Libraries:**
    *   `ConstraintLayout`: For building flexible and responsive layouts.
    *   (Likely) `Fragment`: For modularizing UI components and functionalities within the `fragment_container`.
    *   (Likely) `AppCompatActivity`: As the base class for `MainActivity`.
*   **Material Components for Android:**
    *   `BottomNavigationView`: For implementing the bottom navigation bar.
    *   `TextView`: For displaying text.

## How it Works (Based on `activity_main.xml`)

The `MainActivity` (not provided, but inferred) inflates the `activity_main.xml` layout.

1.  The `FrameLayout` (`fragment_container`) is set up to display different content sections or tools, likely managed by Fragments.
2.  The `TextView` (`bottomInstruction`) provides a clear, static instruction to the user about the app's primary function.
3.  The `BottomNavigationView` allows users to switch between different sections or modes of the application. The actual behavior of navigation (i.e., which Fragment is loaded for which menu item) would be handled in `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`.
